TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I was having some trouble while doing exercise 3. A few failure mode situations had been missed. I should probably drop down some notes before i started writing and perhaps consider things more carefully from different perspectives. Exercise 4 was quite easy for me somehow and i dont know why. i didnt write any notes and used even a single time of debugger. Just following my intuition and put codes down i guess? Anyway ive also got another course which requires much more time on it, so i think time management is really a big challenge for me from this stage.
