TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
what did i do in this week? hmmmmm... dont think ive done a lot of work about 1161 in this week because code1240 doesnt have a flexiable week and i need to work on my NGO presentation. But i did do some catch up about those exercises! online course has been really difficult for me, i just could't get up that early without an esential excuse such as go to unsw... lots of time has been wasted on the bed by me and i really hope the covid situation would turn good in a short time so i can go to campus for term3...
