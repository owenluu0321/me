TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In my opinion, the last few questions were a bit difficult for me during quiz, especially the last one, i had no idea about where to start it. i also over-complicated some of the questions, and i had to go through them by a second or a third time in order to pass it. The quiz was definately too long for me, i think having 4 hours only will be much better than having extra 10 hours of time. So i can focus on getting the marks i can 100% get instead of going through all of them over and over again all day and keeping failing again.
