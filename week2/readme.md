TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Personally thinking that i am still not completely familiar with the logic of programming and computational language. For example the issue is mainly appeared in counting integers while we usually start it with 1 and devices start from 0. I need to spend more time on orgnising answers, to translate the difference between them. I believe that this specfic issue could be soloved easily with more practice as we study deeper into the course.  I have also asked my friends who has studies python for help and i think it is definately helping me a lot with understanding the codes and communicating with others in this particular area. Also i need to rethink about the format of my answer again. I returned a command with append.(aa) instead of append.(str(aa)) and they have a serious defference them where one is integer and another one is string. That is not able to past the test and help me achieve the result answer required.
