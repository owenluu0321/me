TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Cant believe that 10 weeks have been passed already and this course is nearly finished. This week has been very busy and exhausted for me because i just finished my presentation for code 1240. Now i need to focus on my data project with 12/10 effort. I started to question myself about this course, what exactly did i learn within the past 10 weeks... I have learned some really basic programming logic and skills within this course, but they are not enough for me in the future. Addtionally, i did a huge numbers of researches online and that was my main method of learning within the course. Thats a good start for my future learning habit because we are going to need keep learning in our life.
